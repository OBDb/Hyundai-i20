    description: "The original Hyundai i20 was introduced as a supermini (B-segment) car primarily for European and Asian markets. Replacing the Getz in Hyundai's lineup, it featured conventional styling with a focus on practicality and value. Available in three-door and five-door hatchback body styles, it offered good interior space for its external dimensions. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included small-displacement petrol engines ranging from 1.2L to 1.4L and diesel options from 1.1L to 1.4L. The interior was straightforward but well-built, with decent materials for its class and a focus on durability. A significant facelift in 2012 updated the styling and features to maintain competitiveness. This generation established the i20 as a credible competitor in the crowded European supermini segment, offering good value and reliability against established rivals like the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo."

    description: "The second-generation i20 featured a significant step up in design, quality, and features. Adopting Hyundai's 'Fluidic Sculpture 2.0' design language, it offered more sophisticated styling with cleaner lines and a more premium appearance. Available in five-door hatchback, three-door coupe (i20 Coupe), and slightly raised crossover (Active) variants, it provided more options for different buyer preferences. Engine choices evolved to include more efficient units with better performance, typically ranging from 1.0L turbocharged to 1.4L naturally aspirated petrol engines, plus diesel options in many markets. The interior saw major improvements in design, material quality, and technology, featuring available touchscreen infotainment, rear-view camera, and panoramic sunroof on higher trims. Safety features expanded to include six airbags and stability control as standard in many markets. This generation elevated the i20's market position, offering near-compact levels of space and equipment in a supermini package."

    description: "The current i20 features a more angular, aggressive design with Hyundai's 'Sensuous Sportiness' design language. Built on a new platform, it offers improved dimensions with a wider stance and lowered roofline for a more dynamic appearance. Engine options focus increasingly on efficiency with a range of small displacement petrol engines, many featuring 48V mild-hybrid technology to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. The performance-oriented i20 N variant was introduced with a 1.6L turbocharged engine producing 204 HP, establishing the model in the hot hatch segment. The interior represents a major advancement with a digital-focused design featuring a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen in higher trims, creating a connected, dual-screen appearance similar to premium vehicles. Safety technology has advanced significantly with Hyundai SmartSense features including lane-following assist, forward collision avoidance, and intelligent speed limit assistance as standard or available depending on trim. This generation aims to position the i20 as a more emotionally appealing choice in the segment, offering distinctive styling, advanced technology, and driving enjoyment while maintaining the practicality and value proposition that has defined the model."
